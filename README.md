## Coin Clicker:
Upon joining the game, players enter a lobby where they are required to 'ready up' before the game begins.
Once the game begins, players compete to collect the most coins until a target number of coins is reached. Coins spawn randomly and the first player to reach the target number of coins collected wins.


## How to Run: 

1. Run the server.py file

2. Get the IP address of the computer that the server is being run on by putting the follow into your terminal:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Windows:** `ipconfig | findstr /R "IPv4"`<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Linux:** `ip addr show eth0` and look for the "inet" line. <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**MacOS:** `ipconfig getifaddr en0`<br>

3. Then run the client.py and put that as the ip address.

4. Choose a name and begin.
